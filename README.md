# sovereignty_

sovereignty_ is a programming game based on `The Prisoner's Dilemma` of `Game Theory ðŸŽ®`

## `The Prisoner's Dilemma`

`Game Theory ðŸŽ®` is a branch of science that deals with strategies in a random environment

`The Prisoner's Dilemma` is a fascinating problem (its actually a game) that emerges from `Game Theory ðŸŽ®`

sovereignty_ is for everyone to quickly setup a player & play this game. You will find plenty of help in this repo, I will make sure of it.

Here is Veritasium to explain [`The Prisoner's Dilemma`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM)

## _definitions:

- `_player` : the gladiator in the colosseum
    - `_player<human>` : defined by `_programmers` 
    - `_player<droid>` : defined by famous strategies from `Game Theory ðŸŽ®`
- `_rules` : rules every gladiator must obey

## sovereignty_ 

The colosseum only holds the Ferocious Bout ðŸ‘‘ periodically. The date will be well informed to everyone. 

You can pull the PR anytime to build the best `_player` to beat everybody, but a good gladiator knows to hide their design. The good gladiator knows to prepare for the future instead of current.

`_rules` evolve based on everyone's creativity. I invite discussions & PRs. However, the final decision is on me.

## The Ferocious Bout ðŸ‘‘

The Ferocious Bout ðŸ‘‘ will be the undisputable proof of might. The top 10 `_players` will be hailed in the `README` of sovereignty_ ðŸ‘‘ for the whole week.

## current `_rules`

## `_players`

Every `_player` must have a `username` and an `identity : emoji`.

### Current `_players`:
1. skywalker ðŸ”¦
