# sovereignty\_ (under dev)

:todo clean this

sovereignty\_ is a programming game based on `The Prisoner's Dilemma` of `Game Theory ðŸŽ®`

## `The Prisoner's Dilemma`

`Game Theory ðŸŽ®` is a branch of science that deals with strategies in a random environment

`The Prisoner's Dilemma` is a fascinating problem (actually its a literal game) that emerges from `Game Theory ðŸŽ®`

sovereignty\_ is for everyone to quickly setup a player & play this game. You will find plenty of help in this repo.

Here is Veritasium to explain [`The Prisoner's Dilemma`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM)

## \_definitions:

- `player` : the gladiator in the colosseum
  - `player<human>` : defined by `programmers`
  - `player<droid>` : defined by famous strategies from `Game Theory ðŸŽ®`
- `rules` : rules every gladiator must obey

## sovereignty\_

The colosseum only holds the Ferocious Bout ðŸ‘‘ periodically. The date will be well informed to everyone.

You can pull the PR anytime to build the best `player` to beat everybody, but a good gladiator has style.

`rules` evolve based on everyone's creativity. I invite discussions & PRs. However, final decision is on me.

## The Ferocious Bout ðŸ‘‘

The Ferocious Bout ðŸ‘‘ will be the undisputable proof of might. The top 10 `players` will be hailed in the `README` of sovereignty\_ ðŸ‘‘ for the whole week.
