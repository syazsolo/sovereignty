# Sovereignty_ 👑

Sovereignty_ is a programming game based on `The Prisoner's Dilemma` of `Game Theory 🎮`

## `The Prisoner's Dilemma`

`Game Theory 🎮` is a branch of science that deals with strategies

`The Prisoner's Dilemma` is a fascinating problem (or a game) that emerges from `Game Theory 🎮`

This _repo is an effort to allow everyone to quickly setup their `_player(s)` & play this game

Here is Veritasium to explain [`The Prisoner's Dilemma`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM)

## _definitions:

- `_player` : the entity that decides to cooperate or defect
    - `_player<human>` : defined by `_programmers` 
    - `_player<droid>` : defined by famous strategies from `Game Theory 🎮`
- `_programmer` : a human who defines `_player(s)<human>`
- `_rules` : rules obeyed by all the `_players`

## Sovereignty_ 


the `_players` will be thrown to the colosseum ⚔️ only once per week

The `_programmer` has a whole week to refine their `_player`

`_rules` evolve based on everyone's creativity. I invite discussions & PRs. However, the final decision is on me.

## The Leaderboard 🏆

The Leaderboard 🏆 will be updated after every fight ⚔️

The top 10 `_players` will be crowned 👑 in the `README` of Sovereignty_ for the whole week

## current `_rules`

## `_players`

Everyone is invited to the colosseum ⚔️

You can join in by sending me a PR (or a pull request) of your `_player(s)`. If the changes only affect what is yours, I will merge in straight away.

Every player must have a `_username : string` and an `_identity : emoji`.
