# Sovereignty_👑

A programming game emulating `The Prisoner's Dilemma` of `Game Theory 🎮`

## `The Prisoner's Dilemma`

It is a famous problem from the science of `Game Theory 🎮`. Here is [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM) to explain.

## _definitions:

- `_programmer` : the human who is playing Sovereignty_👑 
- `_player` : the code-counterpart of the `_programmer`. `_this` is what the `_programmer` throws in the colosseum ⚔️
- `_rules` : `_players` obey the `_rules`

## The rules of Sovereignty_👑 

As Dota has Ice Frog, Sovereignty_👑 has me

the `_players` will be thrown to the colosseum ⚔️ only once a week

The `_programmer` has plenty of time to refine their `_player` until the fight day

`_rules` evolve based on everyone's creativity. I invite discussions & PRs. However, the final decision is on me.

## The Leaderboard 🏆

The Leaderboard 🏆 will be updated after every fight ⚔️

The top 10 `_players` will be honoured in the `README` of Sovereignty_👑 

## `_players`

Everyone is invited to join the fight ⚔️

You do that by sending me a PR (Pull Request) of your `_player`. As long as it only affects your `_player`, I will merge in straight away.

Everyone is welcomed, even kids. There should be enough guidelines on how to play.

### Current `_players`:
